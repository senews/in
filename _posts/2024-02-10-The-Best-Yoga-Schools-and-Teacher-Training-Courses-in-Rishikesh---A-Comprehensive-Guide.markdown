Several schools also offer specialized workshops focusing on specific styles like Kundalini, Yin, prenatal and restorative yoga.
## Fees and Factors for Yoga Teacher Training
Yoga teacher training costs in Rishikesh are very reasonable considering the highly qualified gurus and picturesque ashram settings. A standard 200-hour program ranges from $800-1500 depending on particular amenities and school reputation. The top schools may charge closer to $1500 while many newer options stay below $1000. 300-hour trainings are generally a minimum of $1200 on average. Accommodation during the courses also influences total payment, from basic dorm rooms to private huts with river views. Students should budget $15-30 per day for lodging. Class sizes, included meals, teacher experience level and location are other aspects that impact teacher training price points.
## Choosing the Right School - Do Your Research
With so many yoga schools located in and around Rishikesh, deciding where to complete yoga teacher training can feel overwhelming. The best approach is dedicating time beforehand to thoroughly research multiple programs online and through firsthand visits if possible. Watching sample classes, meeting teachers and chatting with current/past students provides valuable insights. Considering teaching style, curriculum depth, amenities, environment and schedules helps narrow options. Be wary of "paper schools" that only operate virtually without a real physical presence. Opt for established ashrams with a proven track record of quality education and professional support.
