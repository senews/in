## Introduction 
Yoga is a perfect way to improve flexibility, mobility and build strength over time. Maintaining good flexibility and mobility is crucial for preventing injuries, reducing aches and pains, and allowing us to perform daily activities without issues. Through consistent yoga practice, we can enhance our range of motion in the joints and loosen tight muscles. 
In this blog post, I will outline effective yoga poses and routines to help you achieve your flexibility and strength goals. We will start with sun salutations to warm up the body. Then explore various stretching, strengthening and balancing poses suitable for all levels. I will also discuss the importance of form, listening to your body and allowing the poses to open up gradually over weeks of practice. Let's get started on your yoga journey!
### The Foundation: Sun Salutations
Sun salutations or Surya Namaskar is a sequence of 12 graceful poses that flow together. It is one of the best dynamic warm up exercises to prepare the body for an asana (pose) practice. A 15 minute daily practice of sun salutations will gradually improve your flexibility in the hips, shoulders, hamstrings and back. The repeated movements also enhance blood circulation and get your heart pumping. As you hold each pose for 5 breaths, it allows your body to lengthen and open up before moving into the next posture.  With consistent practice, you will see improvements in your overall range of motion.

## Stretching Poses
### Child's Pose
Child's pose is an excellent posture to release tension in the back, hips and shoulders after long hours of sitting. From all fours, sink your belly between thighs and reach arms forward to stretch the front body. Hold for 5 breaths to feel a lovely release in the lower back. 
### Downward Facing Dog
This versatile pose engages the whole body. From all fours, tuck toes under to lift knees and hips up to form an inverted V shape. Downward facing dog stretches the calves, hamstrings and shoulders while strengthening arms. Hold for 5 breaths and focus on pressing heels down to deepen stretches.
### Seated Forward Fold
To target the tight hamstrings, hips and lower back, sit with legs extended in front. Inhale to lift chest, then exhale fold at hips until torso is parallel to floor. Sit tall with a straight spine. Hold for 5 breaths and gently rock side to side to relieve tension. Over time, you will feel your hamstrings and lower back opening up.
## Strength Poses 
### Plank 
Plank is a full body isometric hold that strengthens arms, shoulders and core muscles. From forearms and toes, lift body to form a straight line from head to heels. Hold for 30 seconds to build upper body strength and endurance. With consistent practice, you will able to hold plank for longer periods.
### Chair Pose
For strengthening legs and toning abdominal muscles, lift hips to rise into a partial squat with feet hip-width apart. Push through heels and lift arms overhead as you press down through feet. Hold for 5 breaths and feel thighs engage as you lift your torso higher.  
### Warrior I & II
Warrior postures improve leg strength, hip mobility and balance. From a high lunge position, twist torso to open towards the front arm in Warrior I. Drop back heel to deepen lunge for Warrior II. Hold each variation for 5 breaths per side to build strength in lower body and improve stability.
### Arm Balances
Arm balances may look challenging but they are hugely beneficial for shoulder and core strength when done correctly. Let's explore a few variations:
## Dolphin Pose 
Dolphin pose allows you to challenge your upper body strength in a low impact way. From all fours, walk hands forward and lift hips up and back to form an inverted V shape with body. Hold for 5 breaths while engaging triceps and shoulder muscles to keep the pose. Over time, your arms will feel stronger.
## Low Lunge to Chaturanga
Starting from a low lunge position with back knee down, inhale to prepare then exhale to lower chest between hands and lift knees, coming into a high push up position known as chaturanga. Inhale to lower halfway, then exhale to lower all the way and repeat for 5 reps to build arm strength for advanced poses.
## Flying Pigeon 
This advanced pose stretches hips, calves and hamstrings while strengthening shoulders. From tabletop, bring one leg forward between hands keeping other leg extended back. Lower chest and forearms to floor while engaging core. Hold for 5 breaths each side. Go slow and remember to listen to your body.
### Inversion Poses
Inversions are calming, rejuvenating and offer many health benefits if done under guidance. Here are a few restorative inversions to add to your routine:  
## Shoulder Stand
Lying on your back, walk feet towards hips and lift them along with torso using hands and elbows. The pose improves circulation, quiets mind and firms abdomen. Hold supported version for 5 mins by keeping feet on wall for support.
## Plow Pose  
From shoulder stand, drop head and shoulders back keeping hips lifted. Plow stretches chest, shoulders and opens hips to relieve tension. Hold for 5 breaths. Come up slowly using hands behind back for support. 
## Legs Up The Wall
One of the most relaxing poses! Sit with tailbone close to wall, lift legs up vertical using hands for support. Let gravity work its magic on legs, hips and shoulders. Stay here for 5-10 mins to decompress after a long day.
### Balancing Poses
Mastering your balance through yoga leads to increased focus, concentration and stability. Here are a few poses to challenge your equilibrium:
## Tree Pose
Stand on one leg and bring other foot to inner thigh or calf for this basic but beneficial balance pose. Raise arms overhead and focus gaze for 30 seconds each side. Over time, you can progress by bringing foot higher on thigh.
## Dancer's Pose 
From lunge position, lift back knee and foot to bring it parallel to floor while keeping hips squared. Raise arms overhead and balance on front leg for 30 seconds. Repeat on other side regularly for strong, stable legs. 
## Half Moon Pose
One of the most liberating hip openers. From a high lunge, bring hand to floor outside front foot and raise other arm towards sky. Gaze up as you find stillness in the challenging asymmetrical position. Hold for 5 breaths each side.
## Conclusion
While yoga looks simple, to reap full benefits it's important to pay attention to form, breathe fully in each posture and avoid pushing limits. Listen to body signals and come in and out of poses slowly using hands for support. Be patient and give your body time to open up at its own pace through consistent sun salutations and an all-level asana practice 2-3 times a week. Yoga is a gift that keeps on giving - for flexibility, strength and overall well-being.
