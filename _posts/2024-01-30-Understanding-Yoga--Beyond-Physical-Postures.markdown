### The Four Paths of Yoga
Bhakti Yoga is the path of devotion through surrender to God. This was taught by Jesus Christ and in the New Testament. It was meant for priests.  Karma Yoga is the path of selfless service without expectations. This path was taught by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita and was meant for workers. Jnana Yoga is the path of self-knowledge through inquiry and study of sacred texts. This path was pioneered by Adi Shankaracharya and meant for business people. It includes the 6 philosophies of Hinduism. Raj Yoga is the path of controlling the body through postures and mind through meditation. Sage Patanjali organized this path known as Ashtanga or 8-limbed yoga. Postures are just 1/8 of this path meant for warriors.

### The True Meaning and Objective of Yoga
Yoga means the union of the finite soul (Jeevatma) and the Infinite Soul (Paramatma). Meditation dissolves thoughts allowing this union where man becomes God. The ultimate objective is salvation or moksha through completely burning karma through enlightenment. Temporary burning is savikalpa samadhi and permanent is nirvikalpa samadhi.
### Kriya Yoga, the Real Kundalini Yoga  
Kriya yoga, not the modern Kundalini yoga, is what Lord Krishna and Patanjali referenced and what Jesus taught his disciples. The concept of the Holy Spirit descending is actually the raising of Kundalini Shakti to Sahasrara chakra. Kriya yoga calms the mind and breath quicker than other practices.
### Asanas are Just Preparation for Meditation   
Physical postures are not the true practice of yoga but preparation for meditation. Meditation is real yoga. Yoga certification courses are misleading, a true yogi evolves over lifetimes through hard work not a month-long course.
### Differentiating Kundalini and Jnana Yoga
Kundalini yoga focuses on awakening dormant spiritual energy through dynamic practices involving breath, poses and meditation to stimulate energy flow. Jnana yoga is the path of intellectual inquiry and detachment from ego/body seeking self-realization through knowledge and wisdom.
### Dangers of Awakening Kundalini Without Guidance
A personal story of traumatic physical, emotional and psychological effects from awakening Kundalini without a master including insomnia, nightmares, hallucinations and more. Kundalini is too complex and should only be practiced as part of the whole system under expert guidance.
### Finding a Qualified Kundalini Yoga Teacher   
To properly practice Kundalini yoga, one must study with an enlightened master over many years, not learn from books alone.
### Kundalini is Primordial Cosmic Energy
According to scriptures, Kundalini is made of inert matter from the sun, it is the indwelling human soul and a mysterious divine force (Shakti) present in all beings.
### The Soul is Kundalini
Per ancient Akhand Sutra scripture, the indwelling human Soul is called Kundalini. When awakened and ascended correctly with guidance, Kundalini allows union with the infinite soul.
