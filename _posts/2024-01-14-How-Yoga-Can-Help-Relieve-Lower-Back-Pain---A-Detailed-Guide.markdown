### Core Strengthening and Spine Alignment
Strong core muscles are essential for supporting the lower back and maintaining proper spinal alignment. Plank, boat pose, and low lunge are excellent poses to engage the deep abdominal muscles. Holding these poses for several breaths helps build core strength. This improved strength provides better posture and takes pressure off the back.
### Gentle Stretching and Release
Child's pose, cobra pose, and cat-cow stretches are wonderful for gently mobilizing the spine. They relieve built-up tension and improve flexibility. Performing these poses while focusing on the breath also promotes stress reduction. Connecting breath with movement has mindfulness benefits that can aid in back pain management.
### Back Strengthening
Cat-cow, low lunge, and table top pose effectively work the back muscles. These poses enhance back stability and endurance. Over time, consistently performing these poses builds core and back strength. Stronger back muscles better support the weight of the upper body, reducing strain on the lower spine.  
### Hip Mobility
Tight hips can tug on the lower back and compromise posture. Pigeon pose, lizard pose, and lunging variations effectively target the hip flexors and surrounding muscles. Increased hip mobility and flexibility through these poses improves posture and takes pressure off the lower back.
### Shoulder Opening
Downward dog, thread the needle, and child's pose are excellent for opening the chest and shoulders. Tight shoulders pull the upper back out of proper alignment, adding undue stress to the lower spine. These poses counteract that strain and help maintain a neutral spine.
### Breathing Practices 
Deep yoga breathing techniques cultivate mindfulness and body awareness. Abdominal breathing and complete breathing train the mind-body connection. Focused breathing during poses helps release muscle tension and alleviates pain. Controlled breathing also calms the nervous system for stress management.
### Gentle Inversions
Supported bridge pose and shoulder stand gently decompress the spine by reversing the effects of gravity. They improve circulation and relax tight back muscles. Beginning with brief held inversions and gradually building duration over time provides safe benefits for back pain relief.  
### Developing a Routine
Consistency yields the best results for back pain relief. Start any routine slowly, listen to your body, and adjust the poses based on progress and abilities. Over time, a regular home practice gradually provides powerful long-term benefits for managing chronic lower back discomfort.
