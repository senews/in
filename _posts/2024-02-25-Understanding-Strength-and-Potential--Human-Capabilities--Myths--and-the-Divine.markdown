Hanuman from the Hindu epic Ramayana displays feats of strength well beyond normal human limits, such as lifting an entire mountain. Symbolic of devotion and service, Hanuman's myths personify divine aid enabling otherwise impossible acts through surrender to higher purpose.
### Separating Fact from Fiction
While inspiring, myths should not be taken as literal history. Stories serve cultural and spiritual functions rather than documentation. Through symbolism, myths convey perspectives on human potential and limitations. Realism requires distinguishing fantastic from fact based on evidence and natural laws.
### Pushing the Boundaries of Human Potential
With rigorous training, diet and lifestyle optimization, exceptional strength levels can be achieved. Records continuously surpass what was previously thought possible. However, inherent biological factors set boundaries on human anatomy restricting certain mythical acts no matter the commitment. Understanding these constraints informs realistic perspectives.

Cultural histories, values and spiritual insights emerge from exploring underlying metaphorical dimensions beyond superficial readings.
### Glimpses of Transcendent Principles
Across religions, certain figures represent divine intervention or transcendence of normal human conditions. Myths depicting supernatural prowess allude to subtle spiritual forces and energetic principles only partially grasped scientifically. Archetypes like Hanuman signify enlightened capabilities hinting at humanity's vast undiscovered potential.
### Interdependence in Creation
A holistic worldview sees all existence as interwoven, with creator and created indistinguishable in their intricate interdependence. From this nondual perspective, myths of superhuman strength metaphorically portray humanity's inseparable link to the infinite source of all possibility latent within and around us.
### Evolving Perspectives 
As scientific insights expand what's considered feasible, concepts of human and divine potential likewise shift and merge with technology extending native capacities. Ancient myths progressively take on new metaphorical life reflecting society's changing interface with its environment and deepening self-understanding.
### Beyond Comprehension
Ultimately, life's greatest questions lie beyond definitive human answers. The full nature of creation and consciousness may eternally surpass reductionist explanations. Myths acknowledging mystery's unsolvability cultivate humility and openness where certainty ends. Their wisdom contents itself revealing truths through allegory rather than claims of final knowledge.
