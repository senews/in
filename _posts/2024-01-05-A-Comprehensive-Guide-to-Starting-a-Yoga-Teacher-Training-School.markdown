## Choosing the Right Location
Accessibility is key when choosing a location for your yoga teacher training school. Consider areas that are easily accessible via major highways or public transportation. This will make it convenient for students to commute. Nature is also important - being situated near parks, beaches or other lush outdoor spaces provides the tranquility and inspiration that yoga seeks to cultivate. Ensure your facility has ample natural lighting and ventilation. Indoor space requirements will depend on your intended class sizes but allow for comfortable movement and flow.
### Proximity to Nature
Being close to parks, beaches, gardens or greenbelts allows you to incorporate nature-based elements into your programming. Outdoor yogaclasses and meditation sessions can help students relax and recharge. Access to wooded trails or environmental preserves provides opportunities for mindful walks between sessions. Nature has inherent healing properties that enhance any yoga experience.

## Obtaining Industry Affiliation and Certification 
There are several accrediting bodies that set curriculum standards and confer certifications for yoga teacher training programs. Yoga Alliance is a widely recognized nonprofit that accredits RYT 200-hour, 300-hour and 500-hour programs. The Quality Council of India also provides certifications for yoga schools and teachers in India. 
### Choosing the Right Accreditor
Carefully research the requirements, codes of conduct and credentialing processes of different accreditors to determine the best fit. Consider factors like your intended student demographics, program scope and geographic location served. University affiliations are prestigious options but involve rigorous academic standards. Yoga Alliance certification ensures credibility with students while allowing flexibility in operations.
## Developing Comprehensive Program Offerings
The standard RYT 200-hour and 300-hour programs form the core curriculum and are prerequisites for advancing teacher certifications. These should always be offered initially to attract serious yoga students. 
### Adding Specialty Programs
Once established, additional specialty programs can be introduced 1-2 times per year based on emerging trends and teacher expertise. Examples include Prenatal Yoga Teacher Training, Ashtanga Yoga Intensive, Yin Yoga Certification, Meditation Teacher Training and Adaptive Yoga. Niche programs cultivate interest while utilizing full teaching faculty.
## Setting Faculty Requirements
The heart of any successful yoga school is its teaching faculty. Lead instructors must have extensive experience, impeccable teaching skills and hold respected yoga certifications. 
### Upholding High Standards
All teachers should embody the yogic ideals of discipline, integrity and service. Strict codes of conduct ensure no abuse of power dynamics with students. Continuing education is required to stay current on latest research and methods. Faculty evaluations and student feedback aid constant improvement.
## Operating Costs and Budget Planning
Forecasting expenses and revenue streams is crucial for long-term viability. Fixed costs include facilities rental/purchase, utilities, property taxes, business licences and insurance policies. 
### Projecting Variable Expenses
Variable costs that fluctuate with program activity are teacher salaries, marketing budgets, office supplies, equipment upgrades and administration/payroll fees. Detailed financial models factor in projected student enrollments to determine ideal pricing. Contingency reserves allow flexibility to adjust budgets as needs change.
## Marketing Strategy and Recruitment Planning
An comprehensive marketing strategy is required from inception to attract suitable student applicants. 
### Targeting the Right Demographic
Identifying target demographics of local yoga communities informs where and how to promote. Digital and print materials highlight unique program attributes to drive interest. Partnerships with gyms, wellness studios and related organizations provide cross-promotion. Guest teaching spots introduce potential students to faculty qualifications. 
## Ensuring Financial Sustainability
Building enrollment to the break-even point is crucial for long-term operation. Revenue projections should conservatively factor seasonality and market uncertainties.
### Supplementing Core Programs  
Supplementary programs like 200-hour TTCs during summers/winters can boost lean periods and expedite breakeven. Workshops, retreats and private sessions offer ancillary income streams. Careful pricing considers local competitors while covering fixed overhead. Financial models adapt over time as operations mature.
## Maintaining Curriculum Relevance
Continual research helps the curriculum stay pertinent in a dynamic industry. Teaching techniques should evolve based on current yoga and wellness science. 
### Pursuing Ongoing Accreditation
Accreditation renewals involve substantive reviews to confirm ongoing quality standards. Advisory boards provide objective input on curricular revisions, facilities and student satisfaction. External evaluations identify strengths to leverage and areas for improvement.
## Commitment to Personal Sadhana 
As leaders and mentors, yoga teachers must hold themselves to the highest ethical standard. 
### Practicing What You Preach
This means dedicated personal practice (sadhana) to experience yoga's transformational effects firsthand. Teachers serve as role models, embodying yoga's teachings of mindfulness, compassion, and service through actions daily. Lifelong learning nourishes the ability to guide students safely along their own healing journeys.
