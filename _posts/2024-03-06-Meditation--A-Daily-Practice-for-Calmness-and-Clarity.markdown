## Why Meditate
Meditation is a simple yet profoundly powerful practice that can improve both your mental and physical well-being. By taking just a few minutes a day to sit in silent contemplation, you give your mind and body a chance to rest and recharge.

Sit with your back straight, either on a cushion on the floor or in a chair, however is most comfortable. You can keep your eyes closed gently or cast your gaze downward. Focus your awareness on your breathing, noticing the sensations of each inhalation and exhalation without controlling or changing your breath in any way. Your mind will wander, as wandering thoughts are natural - when you notice it has drifted off, gently return your focus to your breathing. Allow your thoughts to come and go without judgment.

### Understanding Meditation
True meditation is being both aware yet thoughtless at the same time. It allows you to experience peace and bliss beyond thoughts and feelings. Keeping your attention focused on one thought, such as a simple word or mantra, helps quiet the restless mind. Recognize yourself as the witness, the silent observer separate from your body and thoughts. View yourself, your physical form, and mental activity from a distance without identifying with or attaching to any of it. This detached state of observance is meditation.
