### Darshana Yoga and the Six Philosophical Systems
The six classical darshanas or schools of Hindu philosophy each offer a unique perspective on life, consciousness, and ultimate reality. Nyaya focuses on logic and reasoning. Vaisheshika examines the basic constituents of nature. Sankhya emphasizes enumeration and differentiation of realities. Yoga seeks to still the fluctuations of the mind. Mimamsa investigates the nature of valid knowledge and dharma. Vedanta examines the essence of the Upanishads and attempts a systematic interpretation of the Vedas. Together they form diverse yet complementary approaches to understanding existence.

### The Four Paths of Yoga
The four main paths of yoga are bhakti (love and devotion), karma (selfless service), jnana (intellect and knowledge), and raja (study of body and mind). Bhakti yoga focuses on surrendering to and worshipping God through singing, dancing, rituals and other spiritual practices. Karma yoga emphasizes performing one's daily duties and living a life of selfless service without attachment to results. Jnana yoga's goal is attaining spiritual wisdom and liberation through discriminating knowledge. Raja yoga practices like meditation and physical postures aim to still the modifications of the mind.  
### Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga - The Eight Limbs
Patanjali's Yoga Sutras outline an eight-limbed path known as Ashtanga yoga to achieve higher states of consciousness. The yamas are moral disciplines like non-violence and truthfulness. The niyamas involve personal observances like purity, contentment and spiritual study. Asanas are physical postures that purify and prepare the body for deeper practice. Pranayama techniques control the vital energy of prana through practices like breath extension and retention. Pratyahara withdraws the senses from external attractions toward inner awareness. Dharana focuses attention on a single object. Dhyana absorbs awareness in that object in unbroken concentration. Finally, Samadhi is self-realization and union with the object of focus, resulting in complete stillness of mind. 
### The Origins and Goals of Yoga
The roots of yoga stretch back over 5,000 years to the ancient Vedic texts of India, especially the primary scripture Rig Veda. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit word "yuj" meaning to join, unite or yoke. The ultimate aim of all yoga schools is to reunite individual consciousness with the infinite, supreme reality or universal divine. Through yoga's practices, one sheds identification with the limited ego to realize the immortal essence within, experiencing oneness with the Absolute.
### Applying Yoga as a Way of Life  
Yoga is not limited to asanas and meditation alone but extends to daily living. Its goal is transcending all limitations and finding harmony within and without. This involves cultivating virtues of non-harming, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness as well as purity, contentment, spiritual discipline, self-study and surrender to the divine. By applying yogic principles moment to moment, one can move beyond conditioning and dualistic perceptions to experience life as a continuous flow of unity.
### Expanding Consciousness through Yoga
Yoga offers transformational practices to cultivate expanded awareness. Through controlled breathing techniques like pranayama, consciousness can rise beyond the physical identification. Meditation further plumbs the depths of silence and stillness within to experience the indivisible current of existence. As awareness disentangles from modifications of body and mind, true nature independent of form emerges in fullness. One directly perceives the continuity of all beings and things in transcendental Consciousness.
### The Mechanisms of Union 
Techniques derived from the ancient Vedas like japa and dhyana meditation help still the incessant fluctuations of the limited intellect. By bringing the life force back to its source in the breath, divisions between subject and object dissolve. Stillness reveals the unconditioned is empty of attributes yet everything's essential ground. The differentiated manifests as appearances in undivided Being alone while Being itself is unmanifest yet pervading all.
### Experiencing Oneness
Yogic practices extend sensory capacities to merge with the infinite whole. Through asana, outer boundary dissolves as one feels every cell vibrating in unison. In pranayama, the life force circulates without obstruction revealing inner and outer breath as non-dual. With drawing the senses in pratyahara, awareness embraces the panoramic field as a continuous field of conscious force. Resting as the witness, the unbounded seer transcends identifications to behold the universe inwardly and oneself universally diffused.
### Living in Union
The goal of yoga is living established in intrinsic harmony rather than opportunistically experiencing it. This requires continually immersed in the source through daily activities yet untouched by reactions and clinging. With virtue, diligent practice and spiritual discernment, the vision of oneness permeates every moment. One moves, rests and interacts from the still center - the silent Witness ever serenely established in peace, power and freedom beyond form. This is yoga's complete science of liberation and highest mastery - dissolving in pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss.
