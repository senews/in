## Understanding the Influence of Rahu Dasha

Rahu, the lunar node known as the north node of the Moon, brings profound changes during its 18-year cycle known as Rahu Mahadasha. Lasting nearly two decades, a Rahu period can upend various areas of life including career, relationships, finances, education and more.
