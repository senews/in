### The Seven Classic Paths of Yoga
Bhakti yoga focuses on devotion to God. It involves surrendering to the divine through prayer, worship and spiritual love. Karma yoga emphasizes selfless service and good works without concern for personal gain. Through karma yoga, one realizes they are not the doer but merely an instrument of the divine. Jnana yoga focuses on acquiring spiritual wisdom and knowledge of the true self. It involves intense scriptural study, philosophical pondering and meditation. Raja yoga encompasses the eight limbs of yoga involving ethical discipline, physical postures, breath control, sensory withdrawal, concentration, meditation and ultimate union with God. Hatha yoga utilizes physical postures called asanas and breathing techniques called pranayama to purify the body and prepare it for higher yoga. Kundalini yoga aims to awaken the dormant spiritual energy called kundalini shakti through meditation, breath control, mantra chanting and visualization. Mantra yoga uses sacred sounds and syllables as tools for meditation and connecting to the divine.

### The Saptarishis and Their Spiritual Missions
The seven revered sages known as the Saptarishis each had a vital role in disseminating a specific path of yoga according to Lord Shiva. Agastya rishi was responsible for spreading jnana yoga. Vashishta rishi focused on bhakti yoga. Viswamitra rishi promoted karma yoga. Gautama rishi taught raja yoga. Bharadwaja rishi shared hatha yoga. Jamadagni rishi introduced kundalini yoga. Vishwamitra rishi spread mantra yoga. By sharing their divine wisdom from Mount Meru, these sages helped make yoga accessible to all people regardless of caste or social standing.
### Aligning Yoga and Chakras
Each of the seven sages and their aspect of yoga correspond to a specific chakra based on energy location and qualities. Agastya rishi's jnana yoga aligns with the brow chakra related to wisdom and intuition. Vashishta rishi's bhakti yoga matches the throat chakra of devotion and expression. Viswamitra rishi's karma yoga connects to the heart chakra governing relationships and duty. Gautama rishi's raja yoga associates to the crown chakra of highest consciousness. Bharadwaja rishi's hatha yoga links to the solar plexus chakra ruling willpower and discipline. Jamadagni rishi's kundalini yoga interfaces with the root chakra governing transformation. Vishwamitra rishi's mantra yoga syncs to the base of skull chakra linking to subtle sounds.
### Developing a Robust Energy Body 
Ancient yogis acknowledged modern conveniences actually weaken the energy body over time. Excessive sitting, artificial environments, processed foods and constant digital stimulation drain our prana. This makes it challenging to elevate consciousness through higher practices. The yogic lifestyle aims to nourish prana by consuming a sattvic plant-based diet, spending time in nature, reducing toxins, cultivating mindfulness, expressing gratitude and finding community. By strengthening the pranamaya kosha or energy sheath, one builds the fortitude needed for advanced spiritual pursuits.
### Urdhvareta: Transcending Sexual Urges  
Urdhvareta (upward flowing) yoga involves sublimating sexual energy to fuel higher states. Through practices like vajroli mudra, the yoga practitioner gains voluntary control over ejaculation and channels reproductive fluids upward toward the brain. Over time, this leads to decreased attachment to physical pleasures and increased willpower. The realized yogi experiences oneness beyond duality and lives from a place of fullness rather than longing. Urdhvareta is an important step in transcending bodily identification and evolving consciousness.
### Benefits of Yoga Practice
Regular yoga asana and pranayama practice lowers stress, anxiety, high blood pressure and the risks of many diseases. It strengthens the musculoskeletal system, improves digestion, metabolism and sleep. However, yoga's deeper impacts are felt on the mental plane. The meditative nature of yoga cultivates equanimity, detachment, focus and mindfulness - qualities highly valued in Vedic philosophy. Yoga leads to increased self-awareness, self-acceptance, gratitude, joy and contentment regardless of life's storms. By nourishing both body and mind, yoga enhances health and fosters inner tranquility. 
### Awakening the Kundalini Serpent Power  
An advanced goal of yoga involves stimulating the dormant kundalini shakti energy located at the base of the spine. Through dedicated asana, pranayama, bandhas and meditation, the primal lifeforce begins to uncoil and rise upward. As it moves through each successive chakra - muladhara, svadhisthana, manipura, anahata, vishuddhi and ajna - it awakens latent spiritual gifts and confers siddhis or attainments. When kundalini merges with shiva shakti in the crown chakra, divine union or samadhi ensues along with liberation from cycles of birth and death. Awakening kundalini is the culmination of a sadhaka's yoga practice on the path of self-realization.
### The Path to Liberation
With regular sadhana over many lifetimes, the yogi progresses from lower to higher yoga disciplines. Higher practices utilize sophisticated pranayama techniques to induce spiritual awakening and direct sublime energies up the sushumna nadi in the central nervous system. As kundalini is fully aroused and merges with universal consciousness at the sahasrara chakra, moksha or nirvana dawns. At this point, one achieves complete release from suffering and limitations of individual existence. They attain salvation in Satlok, the immaculate realm of eternal truth beyond the cycles of creation. Having realized the immortal atman or soul within via yoga, one gains freedom from further rebirths in maya or the material realm.
### Yoga's Journey Inward
Ultimately, yoga is an inward journey to discover the profound tranquility and boundless wisdom within. While physical postures and breathing practices have benefits, true yoga occurs when one looks within during meditation. By stilling the modifications of the mind, the yogi catches fleeting glimpses of their authentic blissful nature and innate oneness with Brahman - the supreme cosmic consciousness. Through disciplined sadhana over lifetimes, these glimpses deepen into a steady state of liberation. Therefore, yoga's final destination transcends any outer practice - it is complete self-realization and freedom from ignorance of one's own divine essence. The infinite potential for spiritual growth lies dormant within us all awaiting yoga's loving awakening touch.
